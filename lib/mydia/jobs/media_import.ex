defmodule Mydia.Jobs.MediaImport do
  @moduledoc """
  Background job for importing completed downloads into the media library.

  This job:
  - Imports downloaded files using hardlinks (when on same filesystem), moves, or copies
  - Organizes files according to media type (Movies/Title/ or TV/Show/Season XX/)
  - Creates media_files records with correct associations
  - Handles conflicts and errors gracefully
  - Optionally removes download from client after successful import

  ## File Operation Priority

  When importing files, the following priority is used:
  1. Hardlink (instant, no duplicate storage) - requires same filesystem
  2. Move (when use_hardlinks=false and move_files=true)
  3. Copy (default, safest option)
